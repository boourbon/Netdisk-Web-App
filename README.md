NodeJS and JavaScript
<p>This is a netdisk web app writen by me using NodeJS and JavaScript. Users can register and login, and each registered user will have his own database created. 
Users can upload files, preview there uploaded files, and download them. The App will also record the size, the time to upload, and the download times of the resources.
